        At dawn
<br>a field of peonies
<br>Gray flakes arrive
<br>
<br>I wake, move slowly
<br>Vertigo again
<br>And notice
<br>
<br>Certain windows
<br>creaking open to the street
<br>Below is a mess
<br>
<br>I won’t clean it up
<br>I take dictation
<br>writing it all out
<br>
<br>Malibu’s waters
<br>say “hello”
<br>
<br>And “I miss you”
<br>And “don’t make me cry”
<br>
<br>Or “I’d rather get
<br>A boring blow job!”
<br>
<br>On a likely
<br>afternoon in my
<br>studio apartment
<br>
<br>I rub catnip
<br>into a toy shaped
<br>like a fish
<br>
<br>I throw it to my cat
<br>who bats it around and
<br>rubs her face against it
<br>
<br>I assume the thought patterns
<br>of a cat are like a Hans
<br>Hofmann painting
<br>
<br>I read an article that says one
<br>in three art school students
<br>can’t tell the difference
<br>
<br>between a Hans Hofmann
<br>painting and one painted
<br>by a cat
<br>
<br>That is why I gave up painting
<br>
<br>I prefer lines over colors and shapes
<br>
<br>I prefer empty space
<br>I prefer the caress of a judicious goodbye
<br>
<br>I prefer my father on the phone telling
<br>me he doesn’t have any money and
<br>not to call him again
<br>
<br>I am aching to feel red cloth
<br>
<br>Sometimes I smoke cigarettes
<br>Sometimes I do not
<br>
<br>Of all the things
<br>I’ve given up in my life
<br>smoking has been the hardest
<br>
<br>If one exerted a modicum of effort
<br>they could find photos of me
<br>smoking cigarettes
<br>
<br>Sometimes I wear dresses
<br>Sometimes I do not
<br>Of all the things in my life
<br>
<br>I have given up, wearing dresses
<br>has not been so terribly hard
<br>
<br>If one tried
<br>I’m sure it’s possible
<br>
<br>to find a photograph
<br>of me wearing a dress
<br>
<br>My hands are like
<br>moose antlers at the
<br>ends of my arms
<br>
<br>I’m going to touch the milky tips
<br>I’m going to expand upon
<br>the definition of haunting
<br>
<br>White milky cream
<br>
<br>The loudness of chunks
<br>The swish of a gentle chunkiness
<br>
<br>I’m becoming an organless space
<br>I am describing my award-winning speech
<br>
<br>The phone is a heaven
<br>Eighteen thousand beers
<br>
<br>I am contacting the
<br>Bureau of Human Affairs
<br>looking for the Hollywood
<br>
<br>that lives underneath
<br>the fake Hollywood
<br>
<br>I am looking past
<br>the grand boredom
<br>into the desirable shunk
<br>
<br>The word “cunt” is
<br>clearly obscene, but the word “pussy”
<br>makes me physically shudder
<br>
<br>“Pussy” is dirty and sexy because it’s infantilizing
<br>
<br>I find the word “snatch”
<br>more repellent than the
<br>word “pussy”
<br>
<br>I don’t understand the word “trim”
<br>I don’t get what it references
<br>about the vagina
<br>
<br>I wrote all that down
<br>on a napkin during lunch
<br>
<br>Then swallowed it
<br>thinking strange things
<br>about someone’s suicide
<br>
<br>A wet spot grows beneath me
<br>My sneakers are soaked
<br>Every individual path
<br>
<br>The building shakes
<br>when trucks trundle
<br>past on the highway
<br>
<br>I consume yellow breaths
<br>
<br>Yellow pad with laws written on it
<br>A motion, we move, the defense moves
<br>or feelings, the yellow pad has feelings,
<br>also known as complaints, written on it
<br>
<br>Lateral blue slashes, one pink line
<br>Two pink lines, legal notes saying 'move,'
<br>Lateral blue slashes, an invisible pink line
<br>
<br>Letting it melt
<br><span style="margin: 48px">onto my teeth</span>
<br>
<br>July 28, 2004
<br>76 Ryerson St.
<br>Brooklyn, NY 11205
<br>
<br>I’m waking up slowly
<br>into an early evening
<br>
<br>It’s a danger out there
<br>I know it, I can see things
<br>
<br>The state installed electric
<br>signs over freeways
<br>that report child abductions
<br>
<br>They tell you the
<br>make, color and
<br>license plate number
<br>of the suspect’s car
<br>
<br>I want to write down the
<br>information but I’m driving
<br>
<br>Instead I repeat
<br>the plate number
<br>to myself ad infinitum
<br>
<br>After a few miles
<br>someone cuts me off
<br>
<br>and I say, “Damn!
<br>Lost it.”
<br>
<br>After that, all I can do is wait until I
<br>drive past another one of those signs
