  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>I pulled up early to the house I used to live in.
  <br> 
  <br>For the New Year’s party my ex-roomies were throwing.
  <br> 
  <br>I showed up on time, but no one besides my ex-roomies were there, since on time was early at parties.
  <br> 
  <br>I hadn’t been drinking or going to parties for months now, so I’d forgotten.
  <br> 
  <br>But here I was.
  <br> 
  <br>At a party.
  <br> 
  <br>So I started drinking.
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br>Last year’s New Year’s got ugly.
  <br> 
  <br>Happened here, at this house, only back then I still lived in it.
  <br> 
  <br>Had just moved into it.
  <br> 
  <br>Into the third floor ‘closet room.’
  <br> 
  <br>I had, since, graduated into a new ‘closet room,’ across town.
  <br> 
  <br>Well . . . ‘closet-sized.’
  <br> 
  <br>This new room itself had a closet.
  <br> 
  <br>Which I think disqualified it from being a closet.
  <br> 
  <br>But same feel.
  <br> 
  <br>Same claustrophobia.
  <br> 
  <br>Same shitty ventilation.
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br>But last year.
  <br> 
  <br>The beginning of the end.
  <br> 
  <br>Or end of the beginning.
  <br> 
  <br>Or maybe just beginning.
  <br> 
  <br>Of everything.
  <br> 
  <br>Of the sadness.
  <br> 
  <br>Of Reality.
  <br> 
  <br>When ex bae and I decided to open things up.
  <br> 
  <br>Polyamorize.
  <br> 
  <br>Or maybe when ex bae got a firsthand look into how I polyamorized when she wasn’t around.
  <br> 
  <br>Before we’d agreed that polyamory was what we were doing.
  <br> 
  <br>Side bae coming on strong, all of us coming up, and me shrugging like Hey, ex bae, whattaya want me to do?
  <br> 
  <br>Side bae tryna get it.
  <br> 
  <br>That’s her right.
  <br> 
  <br>All about equal rights here.
  <br> 
  <br>Just like it’s my right to be a spineless fuck with no loyalty or resolve.
  <br> 
  <br>Molly, y’all. 
  <br> 
  <br>That dang molly!
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br>This year though.
  <br> 
  <br>This year wasn’t last year.
  <br> 
  <br>This was a New Year.
  <br> 
  <br>Side bae showed up around eleven with the beans, like she’d promised.
  <br> 
  <br>I’d insisted No, not this time around, I was done with that.
  <br> 
  <br>Right up until the moment she procured my double-dose capsule.
  <br> 
  <br>Till she handed me the beer to wash it down with, watching to make sure I swallowed.
  <br> 
  <br>Right up until then, I resisted.
  <br> 
  <br>But how assertively she asserted.
  <br> 
  <br>What other choice did I have.
  <br> 
  <br>Yes ma’am, I said, swallowing.
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br>Too much activity going on, all around.
  <br> 
  <br>I returned to the middle-room couch.
  <br> 
  <br>Next to the roomie, who showed up with his wifey not long before side bae did.
  <br> 
  <br>He was on something too, wasn’t sure what. 
  <br> 
  <br>But we started talking faster and faster and more emotionally and less judgmentally.
  <br> 
  <br>I’d cut my hair, dolled myself up, and washed for tonight.
  <br> 
  <br>Felt prettier and prettier the more people showed.
  <br> 
  <br>Still didn’t interact with anyone besides the roomie and those who approached me&mdash;in the corner, on the couch&mdash;but began conducting myself in a more and more performative way.
  <br> 
  <br>Not performing for anyone.
  <br> 
  <br>Just aware of being watched.
  <br> 
  <br>Laughing more.
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br>Once the bean kicked in I started wilding.
  <br> 
  <br>Flirting up a storm.
  <br> 
  <br>Up and off the couch.
  <br> 
  <br>Roaming.
  <br> 
  <br>No one was off limits.
  <br> 
  <br>Anyone could get it.
  <br> 
  <br>Whispered into peripheral bae’s ear “We both know we both want it. Have wanted it. Tonight’s the night. Tonight you can get it.”
  <br> 
  <br>Then winked and backed away, into a crowd.
  <br> 
  <br>Told ex-roomie bae’s out-of-town, pretty-boy bestie “No you’re right, I guess I don’t know until I’ve tried it. So what are you gonna do to try me?”
  <br> 
  <br>Went up to unfamiliar bae, in the middle of a convo, and corralled her into my dancing vortex when ‘Starboy’ came on again.
  <br> 
  <br>Went “Ayyy, college!” when other ex-roomie said “Her?! She’s still in college, bro!” after I asked him if he knew unfamiliar bae and, if so, what her deal was.
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br>Side bae was less than impressed.
  <br> 
  <br>Cornered me in the packed kitchen, by the drink station.
  <br> 
  <br>Said You need to focus.
  <br> 
  <br>Gestured circularly in her face area.
  <br> 
  <br>On this.
  <br> 
  <br>On me.
  <br> 
  <br>Then put her hand on her hip and cocked her head like And? What do you have to say to that?
  <br> 
  <br>Oh side bae.
  <br> 
  <br>Side bae, she was a grown-ass woman.
  <br> 
  <br>Had two years on me.
  <br> 
  <br>Sexy when she told me what to do.
  <br> 
  <br>She knew what she wanted, and how to make known her terms and conditions.
  <br> 
  <br>Thing was, that was only the half.
  <br> 
  <br>Making them known. That was one thing.
  <br> 
  <br>But getting them . . .
  <br> 
  <br>“Hahaaa, ayyy, woah,” I said.
  <br> 
  <br>“Whattaya want from me, bae?” I said.
  <br> 
  <br>“Skiddly doot pop?” I said, handling her hips, touching groins, and smelling her all over&mdash;neck, pits, tummy.
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br>Side bae said: “Dance floor.”
  <br> 
  <br>Grabbed my wrist and led me two rooms over, through a crowd, to the front room.
  <br> 
  <br>To the dance floor.
  <br> 
  <br>Danced with a coy pout on her face, directed towards me until I gave her my full attention; then away from me once I did, but dancing for me, wanting me to watch; and then towards me again when she noticed I wasn’t watching.
  <br> 
  <br>Confusing.
  <br> 
  <br>Sexy!
  <br> 
  <br>But confusing.
  <br> 
  <br>I couldn’t stay focused.
  <br> 
  <br>So many baes.
  <br> 
  <br>Too many feelings.
  <br> 
  <br>Multidirectional feelings.
  <br> 
  <br>And never enough to fill the hole inside.
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <br>Got ensnared in unfamiliar bae’s dance vortex.
  <br> 
  <br>Got sent spiraling her way.
  <br> 
  <br>Wasn’t two two-steps in when I felt myself yanked another way.
  <br> 
  <br>Side bae pulled me into a corner. Hard.
  <br> 
  <br>Harder than she meant to, maybe, because immediately after she went small again.
  <br> 
  <br>She’d initiated it; but somehow, I felt like the dominant one.
  <br> 
  <br>Like she wanted me to be the dominant one.
  <br> 
  <br>Like she was testing me.
  <br> 
  <br>So I did the only thing I could think to. What I coulda sworn she wanted.
  <br> 
  <br>Grasped her by the neck&mdash;firmly enough for her to feel it, gently enough to not leave a mark or obstruct her breathing, just like she’d taught me&mdash;and pinned her to the wall, leaning in to nuzzle her ear.
  <br> 
  <br>She grabbed my wrist. Hard.
  <br> 
  <br>Said No.
  <br> 
  <br>Not here.
  <br> 
  <br>Not in front of people.
  <br> 
  <br>Not unless I say to.
