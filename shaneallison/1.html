<br><b>If Only the World Were a Giant Belgian Waffle</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>I understand the human Belgian waffle
<br>I wish the world was a giant Belgian waffle
<br>I laugh at Billy the giant Belgian waffle
<br>I touch the hairs on my father’s Belgian waffle
<br>I slept on the freezing cold Belgian waffle
<br>I dreamt I could be an impressionable Belgian waffle
<br>I cried when my Belgian waffle died
<br>I hear the call of the Belgian waffle
<br>I touch myself when I see a Belgian waffle
<br>I am the man of the Belgian waffle when my dad’s away
<br>I wish they would stop peeking at my Belgian waffle
<br>I smell a Belgian waffle of accomplishment
<br>Why am I here, Belgian Waffle?
<br>I think of snow covered Belgian waffles
<br>I can’t love you like my Belgian waffle
<br>I feel this Belgian waffle destroying our love
<br>I wish I could speak a little more Belgian waffle
<br>I wonder what would happen if I ever lost that Belgian waffle
<br>I enjoy talking to Belgian waffles and sharing Belgian waffle memories
<br>I just felt a Belgian waffle rub up against my arm
<br>I pretend sometimes to be queen of the Belgian waffle
<br>I understand that you have a slight problem with your Belgian waffle?
<br>I hope George Clooney will come to my Belgian waffle party
<br>I know I am crazy because my Belgian waffle is
<br>I like my Belgian waffle because he bites people
<br>I know 9,528 Belgian waffles with an F
<br>I fight with the security guard who tries to take my Belgian waffle
<br>I enjoy the flowers of the Belgian waffles
<br>Excuse me, but I hear my Belgian waffle calling me

<br><b>Here’s the Thing</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>I love you most when you’re sipping soup
<br>When the juice from the chicken soup
<br>Leaks like a leak from the bottom of the spoon
<br>When the spoon is filled to the rim
<br>With chicken soup juice & you are sipping
<br>Sipped chicken juice from the spooned chicken soup
<br>&amp; the noodles make a big splash in the pool bowl
<br>In your pool bowl of soup, chicken soup
<br>Chicken souped juices sipped from your chicken soup spoon
<br>From your chicken soup pool bowl
<br>That has a spoon like a pickle
<br>You are the bestest
<br>The most dreamiest
<br>The most marvelousiest
<br>When you eat pickle
<br>There is nothing more superb
<br>Than a pickle-eating man
<br>Eating pickle-eating pickles
<br>I am such the pickle for a pickle-eating marvelous man
<br>For chicken soup sipping sipness
<br>A pickle juice punk
<br>That is what I am
<br>A pickle juice punk for your fingers pickle juice-stained with pickle juice
<br>Chicken juice soupiness
<br>Chicken juice sipness sipping pickle juice pinkness
<br>Can’t decide between you
<br>Can’t decide between the two
<br>Chicken soup juices or pickle juice juices
<br>You sipping chicken soup soupiness soup
<br>From pickle juice juiciness juices
<br>I am as sharp as a noodle
<br>My thoughts run down the pickle train train tracks of pickles
<br>Join me
<br>Join in
<br>Join in me for chicken noodled noodles
<br>For pickled pickles pickened
