      <b>Phoenix Bar on Friday Night</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Big cheap rings, rhinestone encrusted,<br>
      She proudly said they were imported<br>
      “If I came in here dressed as a man, <br>
      You wouldn't recognize me, honey.”<br>
      <br>
      She let her hands play with the hair<br>
      On my chest as she talked. “I like <br>
      This,” she said. “I don't like any<br>
      Hair on my body at all, but yours is fine. <br>
      <br>
      “In high school they made fun of me.<br>
      I told them: I'm not a girl (stomping out the words).<br>
      Now when someone calls me ma'am<br>
      I say, ‘Oh, thank you.’”<br>
      <br>
      <br><br>
      <b>Mike from Minneapolis</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      His hand extends as I slide by<br>
      And brushes the front of my shorts<br>
      So I slow to a stop on the opposite side<br>
      And say B And he says Mike<br>
      Mike from Minneapolis <br>
      <br>
      What do you like?<br>
      I say what<br>
      Sexually<br>
      Not fucking what about you <br>
      Choking on a big cock like this<br>
      <br>
      He takes me downstairs where there is more room<br>
      As I am opening his shirt comes a guy<br>
      Into the back room. Do you like this <br>
      I say being welcoming and polite<br>
      He is looking at Mike not at me<br>
      Then and then and then <br>
      Mike breaks off sucking my cock<br>
      And says do you fuck<br>
      Which we already covered upstairs<br>
      But I just say no<br>
      <br>
      So now the new guy is fucking Mike<br>
      While I'm sucking his and trying <br>
      To do the right thing to make a contribution<br>
      While he tells the new guy that he is rocking<br>
      His (Mike’s) world <br>
      <br>
      So it all finishes with him telling the new guy that<br>
      His name is Trent and I say you told me<br>
      It was Mike. And he just said yeah but <br>
      It was so good. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br><b>Quanah Parker and Running Deer</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Not being given to rage <br>
      I find it hard to imagine what<br>
      it felt like to throw the cup of<br>
      Coke and ice at a boyfriend in the car<br>
      or to take a belt after your wife<br>
      I can't even imagine really beating<br>
      a dog. Yet this morning as we <br>
      rounded Quanah Parker onto<br>
      Running Deer that black dog<br>
      from across the street got in <br>
      my way and for a half of a second<br>
      not more but that was enough<br>
      I felt like hammering the dog<br>
      to death. I have stuff on my mind. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br><b>In the Bastrop Pines</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      You don't even remember<br>
      when you brought back to this <br>
      house the cranium shaped rock.<br>
      We caught it in the Bastrop pines<br>
      now devastated by the fire a few<br>
      years back and you I remember or<br>
      imagine hoisted it on your shoulder<br>
      although it weighs no more than two<br>
      pounds or three to walk back with it <br>
      to the car and now it sits there on the <br>
      railing of the deck a copper colored <br>
      recollection of the firstlings of our<br>
      what I was going to call our love but<br>
      I stepped back from that thinking<br>
      it would put you off and yet I have<br>
      this rock this solid reminiscence<br>
      of a time back then when I expected and<br>
      imagined something memorable and solid.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br><b>Right on the Coffee Table</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      She was in Wisconsin and I was in <br>
      the apartment alone for once. What<br>
      did I do? I got a gay magazine <i>Mandate</i><br>
      or <i>Torso</i> or <i>In Touch</i> with on the cover<br>
      (because in this story the cover is the<br>
      crucial item) on the cover a picture<br>
      of a dark haired light skinned man just<br>
      his body from the stomach up and <br>
      his lovely Greek-looking face and<br>
      I put that magazine (so obviously <br>
      gay) right on the coffee table like it<br>
      was <i>Life</i> or <i>Architectural Digest</i> <br>
      or <i>National Geographic</i> and I <br>
      stepped back and looked at it<br>
      and felt wonderful for a moment<br>
      then I went over and pulled closed<br>
      all the curtains even though the<br>
      apartment was on the second floor. <br>
      <br>
      <br><br>
      <b>Fucking Fool</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      Last night at the intersection of Quanah Parker<br>
      and Running Deer I saw a man a guy standing<br>
      by the fence leaning against the fence and as<br>
      I passed with the dog I said Hey how's it goin'<br>
      and he said back Good and you? but that's not <br>
      The poem the poem is that as I went down the hill <br>
      I thought about him (he had his shirt off)<br>
      and when I looked back he was standing<br>
      by the road looking down the road<br>
      toward me. That's the poem. The thing is<br>
      that the poem has no footnotes saying "and<br>
      it was true, my fantasy" the poem has only<br>
      final stanzas with such themes as "never <br>
      saw him again" or "not what I thought"<br>
      or even "why am I such a fucking fool?"<br>
      <br>
      <br><br>
      <b>Hard Labor</b>
      <br>
      <br>
      The exquisite rejection almost delicious<br>
      To remember the head turned away the<br>
      Devastating crossing of paths in the hall<br>
      With no acknowledgement not one glance<br>
      Of recognition almost too hard not to treasure<br>
      Like our secret sacred cache of incomprehensibly<br>
      Instinctual cruelties. A second or third or fourth<br>
      Birth trauma which we endure to be able to breathe<br>
      Independently and to realize after the blood <br>
      Is washed away that we are inescapably joined.
