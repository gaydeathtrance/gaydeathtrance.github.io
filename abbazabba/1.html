<br>Little to no information upon drawing a background report
<br>
<br>It’s pretty easy to scrub the public stuff
<br>
<br>That also means that person went to that length to do that
<br>
<br>Private early schooling&mdash;Montessori, Waldorf, etc.
<br>
<br>The Bay Area
<br>
<br>New York
<br>
<br>International parents
<br>
<br>Being a giant shitbag weasel all-around
<br>
<br>Controlling art is a key element of social control
<br>
<br>It’s really easy to wipe your history
<br>
<br>It costs money or time, but is very doable
<br>
<br>Feds aren’t necessarily feds, per se
<br>
<br>Most people are already doing what the state wants
<br>
<br>Unwitting CIA/FBI interns
<br>
<br>During MKUltra, the CIA made remote-controlled dogs by implanting electrodes in their brains
<br>
<br>That was over a half-century ago
<br>
<br>Use your imagination
<br>
<br>It’s all you have
<br>
<br>Qualities of character that signal the presence of undercover federal agents in art spaces:
<br>
<br>Creates division while labeling others divisive
<br>
<br>There is so much more
<br>
<br>“What’s your license plate number?”
<br>
<br>Records you without your knowledge or consent
<br>
<br>Promotes and glamorizes/romanticizes drug use
<br>
<br>Smokes weed on Zoom calls
<br>
<br>Chain-smokes cigarettes in public
<br>
<br>They declare the need to meet in parks
<br>
<br>They want to talk through group drama
<br>
<br>They say we are all friends
<br>
<br>We are not friends here
<br>
<br>Some of us definitely aren’t “comrades”
<br>
<br>They discredit women’s suspicions as hysterical
<br>
<br>Intimate partner violence is a leading cause of death among women (especially younger women)
<br>
<br>Courtesy of GoonInc., this poem is called “How to Spot Feds in Art Spaces”
<br>
<br>This is goon propaganda
<br>
<br>This is art-action
<br>
<br>This is a psyop
<br>
<br>An ever-changing, dynamic, intuitive cartoon forcefield of infectious, viral enlightenment, joy, darkness, and truth
<br>
<br>90% of media consumed is owned by 5 corporate conglomerates
<br>
<br>When culture industry interests try to co-opt and neutralize it, we’ve already switched to something different, so it can’t be captured
<br>
<br>You can’t capture freedom
<br>
<br>You can’t fight peace
<br>
<br>Guerilla/Viet Cong style psychic disentangling and reformulation
<br>
<br>No identifiable system or method
<br>
<br>They take over leadership roles and then take unexpected trips
<br>
<br>They need to see stuff still got done the way they wanted while gone
<br>
<br>They take people camping or to a mountain cabin
<br>
<br>They always wear the same fucking shirt (except that one day shit went down)
<br>
<br>They talk about the least secure shit but insist they “understand security culture”
<br>
<br>They use either woke or anti-woke language
<br>
<br>They have the ability to host at a gallery
<br>
<br>They always have the best locations (not great locations)
<br>
<br>They want roommates
<br>
<br>They have a big house a self-employed/freelance artist could never afford, with not quite enough roommates
<br>
<br>They invite some really fed-y people and some really young radicals to all live in their house
<br>
<br>They never say they want to work with cops, but bring into the space people who suggest there are some good cops
<br>
<br>But they hate cops
<br>
<br>But they know so much about cops
<br>
<br>They have reporter/journalist friends
<br>
<br>They work for media companies
<br>
<br>They ask too many questions
<br>
<br>The less information, the more creepy and suspect
<br>
<br>The arrogant thrill of deception smirk sociopaths display
<br>
<br>There are cops on the payroll and volunteer cops
<br>
<br>People like this are never as smart as they think they are
<br>
<br>Closing ranks upon being identified
<br>
<br>Make a loud noise and see how everybody scatters
<br>
<br>Mysterious deaths
<br>
<br>The most effective way to do a hit on someone is to make it seem like an accident/suicide
<br>
<br>The families of these fucks are important, too
<br>
<br>There are CIA and FBI families
<br>
<br>There are neoliberal families
<br>
<br>There is intergenerational wealth at stake
<br>
<br>Kingdoms of violent theft, based on nothing
<br>
<br>Foundations of insubstantiality
<br>
<br>Gelatin molds
<br>
<br>The artifice of greed
<br>
<br>The innovation of innovation
<br>
<br>The progress of progress
<br>
<br>Delete all your social media
<br>
<br>Don’t fuck around in the metaverse
<br>
<br>They map social networks in virtual and real life, in spectacle and on the ground
<br>
<br>There are publications/websites that, in semi-coded, semi-subliminal ways, make political/ideological/religious espousals on either side
<br>
<br>These exist to identify and collect, distract and control people in a meaningless culture war paradigm that ignores reality
<br>
<br>Dark Money
<br>
<br>Honeypots
<br>
<br>I hope the NSA enjoys the humorous conversations I have with my friends, while they eat Chinese takeout before their ridiculous, bloated machines
<br>
<br>I bet they feel bad they’re going to have to kill us with invisible lasers that cause illnesses
<br>
<br>As long as your dissent stays within a cultural simulation, you’re not a threat to power
<br>
<br>Occupy was infiltrated, hijacked, pulled in a bunch of different directions, and eventually broken
<br>
<br>A lot of feds aren’t even aware of other feds involved in the same infiltration
<br>
<br>Black Panthers, Oklahoma City Bombing, etc.
<br>
<br>Major American events that shifted the mood
<br>
<br>People asking if you are “operational”
<br>
<br>Data is available on anyone&mdash;the subversives have been tracked
<br>
<br>It’s a tragic shame, the price of trying to actually challenge powerful, evil shit
<br>
<br>It’s enough to make any rational, normal person give up and just try to live their own life, which is what they want
<br>
<br>Resigned by/with instrumental reason
<br>
<br>Not everybody has the option of giving up, though
<br>
<br>The biggest threat to the powers that be is a truly free person who has accepted their death as a consequence of that struggle
<br>
<br>If enough people did that and exposed the truth, they couldn’t stop it
<br>
<br>I get emotional thinking about it
<br>
<br>(Keeping in mind “they” is “us” and vice versa at any given moment)
<br>
<br>But yeah, the Rothschild family is going to drop a tornado on my grandmother’s house
<br>
<br>You are already dying
<br>
<br>You are focused on your career
<br>
<br>You are gardening 
<br>
<br>A librarian no more
<br>
<br>Every self-employed artist is a threat to the system, and 2 out of 3 are actually the state
<br>
<br>Gain knowledge of firearm safety and practice hand-to-hand combat
<br>
<br>They come out of nowhere and steer the narrative toward the mild-mannered 
<br>
<br>They use either professional or “street” claims of credential
<br>
<br>Their backgrounds won’t seem real at all
<br>
<br>Their dads are ghosts who pay for houses with cash
<br>
<br>Ghost = absolutely no internet trail to them about anything
<br>
<br>“Client work”
<br>
<br>“Foreign copyediting”
<br>
<br>There are no real-life artists who never had to do real jobs, W-2 based work
<br>
<br>Over-the-top LinkedIn profiles
<br>
<br>International art dealers
<br>
<br>Cruise ships
<br>
<br>Instagram
<br>
<br>Not real
<br>
<br>Avatars
<br>
<br>They&mdash; 
<br>
<br>Chain-smoke&mdash;
<br>
<br>Cigarettes&mdash;
<br>
<br>When you call them out, they deflect by accusing someone unrelated of something unrelated
<br>
<br>Gaslighting the whipped
<br>
<br>Ghostriding the dick
<br>
<br>Grief as currency/social capital
<br>
<br>Memorial as humiliation ritual
<br>
<br>Trauma ballin’!
<br>
<br>It’s been a wild last 10 years of culture wars
<br>
<br>They are total scrubs and chumps
<br>
<br>Sheriffs of Fuckingham
<br>
<br>Unironic emoji overuse
<br>
<br>Phantom senses of humor&mdash;the suggestion of laughter without its realization
<br>
<br>These motherfuckers are GLOWING with it
<br>
<br>Shake the tree without showing your hand
<br>
<br>They take over spaces for professional gain
<br>
<br>They put your name places without your consent
<br>
<br>Acknowledgments
<br>
<br>Connections that aren’t there
<br>
<br>They plan in advance and will tell you about it
<br>
<br>Exclusive nonprofits, neoliberal bootlickers
<br>
<br>They act like fools 
<br>
<br>I’m not the crazy one
<br>
<br>Be wary of who you talk to about this
<br>
<br>Someone close to you could be a collector
<br>
<br>Someone you respect and admire
<br>
<br>Don’t let your trust be so easily seduced
<br>
<br>A baiting operator may try to reach out to pump you for information
<br>
<br>They fabricate experiences in their lives, recreate ones that closely mirror your own, in order to strategically ingratiate themselves to you, and on the pretense of this false bond thereby gain your social allegiance
<br>
<br>Empathy siphoning, sympathy mining
<br>
<br>They want to talk one-on-one
<br>
<br>They want to “chat”
<br>
<br>They are sloppy and weird
<br>
<br>They boast of “making moves”
<br>
<br>Their bosses are pissed
<br>
<br>Is it me?
<br>
<br>Am I operational?
<br>
<br>How can you know?
<br>
<br>That’s how it feels
<br>
<br>I came out of nowhere, and to nowhere I will return
<br>
<br>Substance use to cover infiltrator guilt
<br>
<br>The short game, the long game
<br>
<br>The top floor, the ground floor
<br>
<br>Fake conspiracies, real conspiracies
<br>
<br>Operation Mindfuck
<br>
<br>“Subversive poetry”
<br>
<br>The one true tell:
<br>
<br>Is their art actually good?
<br>
<br>My daddy issues are in the stars 
<br>
<br>At least that checks out
<br>
<br>Be honest with yourself about what you really think and feel about what you directly observe
<br>
<br>Don’t just stand behind yourself and think about your thinking
<br>
<br>Reducing the public risk of the surface presentation of your thinking to others
<br>
<br>Don’t defer to the looming shadow of qualitative or moral relativism&mdash;the feigned neutrality of consensus groupthink&mdash;in either art or action
<br>
<br>You are the final authority of your experience, and it’s your choice to grant it to others
<br>
<br>There are people capable of thinking and acting in ways beyond your comprehension
<br>
<br>They will say you’re being paranoid/insane
<br>
<br>But this happened, happens, will happen again, and will continue to happen again
<br>
<br>Shit is about to go down
<br>
<br>Animals before a storm 
<br>
<br>There will always be a new variant
<br>
<br>There will always be a new cosmic object
<br>
<br>So you better be ready
<br>
<br>I am joyful and defiant
<br>
<br>The world vibrates darkly
<br>
<br>I am fucking hilarious
<br>
<br>Anytime anyone does anything cool, someone else is there to Andy Warhol a whole generation
<br>
<br>The fundamental question: 
<br>
<br>Can you produce good art AND be a pig?
<br>
<br>Having an imagination isn’t enough
<br>
<br>You have to actively use it while testing its ideas critically against the history of empires and their subordinate peripheries/proxies
<br>
<br>The prince is safest on the throne immediately after being shot at
<br>
<br>Fuck fascists
<br>
<br>F’sho
<br>
<br>They are here with us right now
<br>
<br>I see you
<br>
<br>*
<br>
<br>Feds&mdash;false prophets of the new millennium&mdash;I stand in total merciless judgment of you
<br>
<br>Celebrity artists, publishers, editors, agents, critics, influencers, podcasters&mdash;the modern priest class
<br>
<br>The world has become a miserable wasteland because of you and those like you
<br>
<br>You who make a vain, sick mockery of life
<br>
<br>Who are you to mock this one, great, and only life?
<br>
<br>You are nobody to mock this life
<br>
<br>This life both you and I are
<br>
<br>This precious human life that will never return again
<br>
<br>This life that is the life of all beings
<br>
<br>This life is nothing to mock
<br>
<br>You will bow your head in sorrowful shame and lay yourself prostrate before this life for how you have failed to live it
<br>
<br>This life is all you love and fear
<br>
<br>You will love this life, and you will fear it!
