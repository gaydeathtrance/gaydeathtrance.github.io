        <b>DOGS BARKING</b>
  <br><br>
  <br>A lesser poet once said
  <br>that his luve was like a red, red rose
  <br>and then went on to compare his luve
  <br>to a song’s melody
  <br>and he said that his love would endure
  <br>all manner of physical and natural tragedy
  <br>dry seas, melted rocks, climate change, etc.
  <br>
  <br>My brain is the city in which dogs intermingle
  <br>My heart is the suburb in which dogs forever bark
  <br>I die in the countryside, found by dogs
  <br>for whom barking is a way of song
  <br>
  <br>When we were all done barking
  <br>we went up into the universe
  <br>and made a baby together: all of us
  <br>It wasn’t pretty
  <br>None of it was pretty
  <br>The process
  <br>The result
  <br>But it happened
  <br>and now we’re here
  <br>and we can’t decide upon a name
  <br><br><br><br><br>
<b>CHRISTIAN MANGLE</b>
  <br><br>
  <br>Impaled on my brain
  <br>is the hat hook on which I hang
  <br>many haloes, those of my idiocy
  <br>and the people I enjoy
  <br>the voices of improbability
  <br>steaming on the hook
  <br>like a wet sun
  <br>
  <br>When someone says <i>ha</i>
  <br>this is the <i>h</i> in <i>christ</i>
  <br>the stigmata that ingests
  <br>the hurt of the world
  <br>in which all the people
  <br>in my phone
  <br>simultaneously
  <br>laugh a non-prescription
  <br>laugh that is unhearable
  <br>but bright<br><br><br><br><br>
  <b>SHOWER LIGHTNING</b>
  <br><br>  <br>
  <i>Because I am dirty
  <br>I must be made clean
  <br>
  <br>Because I am broken
  <br>I must be obscene
  <br>
  <br>Because I am lightning
  <br>I must be so frightening
  <br>
  <br>Because I am water
  <br>I must be drunk
  <br>
  <br>My dreams that I dream
  <br>are closer than ever I thunk
  <br>
  <br>As the water gets hotter
  <br>and time freezes over
  <br>
  <br>The dirt I’ve collected will dance
  <br>its way off of my shoulders</i>
  <br><br>
☈     ☈     ☈     ☈     ☈     ☈ <br>
  <br>I am selling you a product
  <br>It is called shower lightning
  <br>
  <br>You will hang the machine in your shower
  <br>and you will close your eyes
  <br>
  <br>You will listen to recorded thunder
  <br>and imagine yourself naked in a cave
  <br>
  <br>But it doesn’t rain in caves, you retort
  <br>but caves can have waterfalls too, you dork
  <br>
  <br>The thunder piles in from the mouth of the cave
  <br>a wind follows, giving you goosebumps
  <br>
  <br>There is bioluminescence enough to see
  <br>the tips of your fingers as they approach the wall
  <br>
  <br>The life forms turn off their light with your approach
  <br>but you don’t need vision in a cave
  <br>
  <br>The water from the shower hits your face
  <br>and your eyes are now closed to see it
  <br>
  <br>The thunder erupts again
  <br>and shampoo stings your eyes
  <br>
  <br>You will never be clean
  <br>sings the steam from the pipes
  <br>
  <br>Your organs are vital and clean
  <br>Your spirit cadavered and splayed
  <br>
  <br>This is what it is to talk and to think, you think
  <br>You are the inversion of a miracle, twilighting
  <br>
  <br>The lightning strikes around you but never connects
  <br>to the branch on which you’re emblazoned
  <br>
  <br>The branch soaked by your memories
  <br>like water soaked by the rust of its world
  <br>
  <br>You turn off the shower
  <br>allow the storm to continue
  <br>
  <br>You imagine your destruction
  <br>the teeth of the vice you maintain
  <br>
  <br>It seems close to you now
  <br>The storm sounds so close
  <br>
  <br>But as with destruction there is a dial
  <br>to create the illusion of distance and safety
  <br>
  <br>It is measured in miles
  <br>and your fingers can move the storm away
  <br>
  <br>You can make it seem safe
  <br>You can even turn it off
  <br>
  <br>Really, you don’t even need shower lightning
  <br>but the truth is that you want it
  <br>
  <br>I find it impossible to lie to you
  <br>I am the future of marketing
  <br>
  <br>It is a matter of desire and not of necessity
  <br>that the storm surrounds and negates your sense of comfort
  <br>
  <br>It is a matter of your own internal clutter
  <br>that you have not already noticed the eruption
  <br>
  <br>Now open your windows
  <br>Let the branches breathe their way in
  <br>
  <br><br><br><br>

<b>INEVITABILITIES</b>
  <br><br><br>
  We allow the water to lick the plate clean
  <br>of its grease and its gunk
  <br>and we allow not time but tiny beings
  <br>to clean the skin from our bones
  <br>
  <br>On a Sunday I am wounded
  <br>by the television
  <br>I use my hair as a tourniquet
  <br>and my other skin as a bandage
  <br>
  <br>I have to learn a new heartbeat
  <br>if I’m to live in the future
  <br>string a tightrope between myself
  <br>and each person I know
  <br>fall into the chasms between us
  <br>and incubate
  <br>glide a warship silently into oblivion
  <br>
  <br>They’ll write books about it
  <br>and in the books I wash dishes
  <br>at the bank of a river
  <br>and I leave the dishes in the river as rocks
  <br>and I turn off the river
  <br>and darken the sky
  <br>and I say, “I’ll tell a story
  <br>and then another story
  <br>but not today
  <br>and maybe not tomorrow”
  <br>and I put away the scenery
  <br>and I exit the scene

  <b>I WAS A SWAMP</b>
  <br><br><br>
  In a previous life, I was a swamp
  <br>and now in this life driving into a large city
  <br>feels like driving into the internet
  <br>I wish I had enough money to buy every billboard
  <br>between my house and the opposite side of the large city
  <br>In every billboard a picture of family
  <br>Family, in this case, being different swamps
  <br>Each swamp emitting a glitch cloud of gnats
  <br>Each inch of interstate a little heavier than before
  <br>despite its wear beneath the commuter tires
  <br>
  <br>In the morning, I log into who I am
  <br>feeling like the real thing
  <br>I drive seven minutes to the school where I work
  <br>I cross the swollen river
  <br>Drive parallel to my city’s loop
  <br>Swipe a card to enter the building
  <br>Enter my numbers into the machine
  <br>
  <br>Throughout the day, we talk about ways
  <br>to become better people
  <br>I try to settle into who I am at any given moment
  <br>I am honest about who I am, a former swamp
  <br>I sat inside myself so long that I dried up and a meadow replaced me
  <br>No one protected me
  <br>There is something there, I tell my students, if you look
  <br>A flip phone buried in the dirt - once the mud of me
  <br>Lost by a naturalist observing mating fireflies
  <br>My leftover spirit suckling through the wires, attempting to speak
  <br>I say all of us have our swamps or deserts or taigas
  <br>that will one day consume us
  <br>We grow up within them
  <br>Everything about us forms the breadth of the myth
  <br>of human nature
  <br>of atomic being
  <br>
  <br>I drive home to my neighborhood cut into the woods above the river
  <br>turn off who I am as I hide from the world
  <br>bathed in the red of a new episode
  <br>consumed by the glow of my bedside clock
  <br>each digit a firefly mating across the dry skin of my face
  <br>
  <br>How waking up thirsty I know I’ve lived better lives
  <br>
  <br>But who I am at any moment is who I am at any moment
  <br>And who you are at any moment is who you are at any moment
  <br>
  <br>And tomorrow I will forget what I’ve learned
  <br>I will point my phone’s camera into a puddle to collect my reflection
  <br>I will send my reflection into the wild of digitalia
  <br>where, at any moment, we are all who we are
  <br>Or at least we are the billboards of who we hope to be
  <br>standing on the edge of the city, ready
  <br>to jump off its edge and into its dirt packed hard
  <br>into the crystal that reflects its underside
  <br>A spiritual crime scene in which all criminals are free to go
  <br>We must coax them into who they are at any moment given
  <br>They, the names of complex systems of being in which
  <br>everything is of use, then respond by committing crimes against perpetuity
  <br>Dissolving infinities in unchristened sewers
  <br>We merely fit into the way of things
  <br>Read into our harm as if a scar is not merely the universe’s way
  <br>of autographing our bodies
  <br>
  <br>My biggest spiritual crime as a swamp was letting myself dry up
  <br>How so much of me went up into the clouds
  <br>and followed the wind to the next thing
  <br>How unlike a god I am
  <br>How I wish to stand above myself with a watering can
  <br>and drink of who I used to be: a thing
  <br>that believed instead of a thing
  <br>to which doubt and belief are the same
  <br>
  <br>My second biggest spiritual crime was not becoming a fountain
  <br>that churns the pools of everyone else, chlorinated and bright
  <br>whose lessons are learned in the acceptance of what fills it
  <br>and whose coins will tarnish amid the rivers of commerce
  <br>
  <br>I am a swamp
  <br>I am a swamp
  <br>I am a swamp
  <br>This is my attempt
  <br>to regain my form
  <br>My third and final spiritual crime
  <br>is attempting to be anything
  <br>other than what I am
  <br>A transfer of atoms from now to now
  <br>I will be executed by all who love me
  <br>in the gentlest way possible
  <br>They will rain into me
  <br>and I will grow into a perverse thing
  <br>I will disperse
  <br>I will have no shadow
  <br>I will only accept the sun
  <br>I will grow into a cloud of memory
  <br>I will find a plot of sky and keep moving
