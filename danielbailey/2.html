        <!-- ### CHANGE ME ### -->
        I imagine a new hair style
<br> 
<br>I break from life
<br> 
<br>I have many judgments of people
<br> 
<br>I keep them inside me
<br> 
<br>On my perm vacation
<br> 
<br>I am sitting on a free-floating glacier chunk
<br> 
<br>I am leaving Antarctica
<br> 
<br>An emperor penguin is giving me a perm
<br> 
<br>I understand that I will never again see the shore
<br> 
<br>I am locked into this, though the penguin could easily dive off the ice chunk and return to its family
<br> 
<br>The penguin finishes its job. I give my thanks. We say our goodbyes. I tip heartily.
<br> 
<br>The penguin dives off the ice chunk and starts swimming home
<br> 
<br>I wait, perfectly permed, for the ice to melt
<br> 
<br>And it does melt
<br> 
<br>I sit, as long as I can, on the wooden chair painted with typical North American flowers: daisies, tulips, daffodils, etc.
<br> 
<br>I sink
<br> 
<br>It is cold, but it is cool
<br> 
<br>There are leopard seals
<br> 
<br>There are fish I can’t identify
<br> 
<br>There is a school of used condoms
<br> 
<br>I keep sinking
<br> 
<br>I sink through the condoms, taking them with me
<br> 
<br>They are filled with my death children
<br> 
<br>I am their mother
<br> 
<br>I reach the bottom of the ocean
<br> 
<br>My death children are now in kindergarten
<br> 
<br>I have elected to home school
<br> 
<br>God, they are so smart
<br> 
<br>They’ve developed sophisticated, sub-Antarctican accents
<br> 
<br>I can’t believe I must leave them soon
<br> 
<br>I gather them in my bottle
<br> 
<br>To speak to them one last time
<br> 
<br>“My beautiful children
<br> 
<br>You must know
<br> 
<br>Know that I love you
<br> 
<br>And that the world, at best, is not a world
<br> 
<br>It is a constellation at war with itself
<br> 
<br>We are all the ammunition
<br> 
<br>At least that’s what I was raised to believe
<br> 
<br>But I did not raise you to believe this
<br> 
<br>I did not raise you to believe anything
<br> 
<br>Pure experience is enough
<br> 
<br>The world looks at you without judgment
<br> 
<br>You look at the world the same way
<br> 
<br>Now go
<br> 
<br>Move slowly through being
<br> 
<br>Be as slow as possible
<br> 
<br>Make the concept of time envious of your creep
<br> 
<br>I am done”
<br> 
<br>And like that I am finished
<br> 
<br>With my last act, I release my children from the bottle
<br> 
<br>They float outward, dispersing
<br> 
<br>They will evolve to meet this world at its beauty
<br> 
<br>My body will be found centuries later by merpeople
<br> 
<br>They will marvel at my specimen
<br> 
<br>My body will be placed in the Hair Museum
<br> 
<br>The tale of my descent will become a popular tidal zone novel
<br> 
<br>Its title: Immaculate Perm
<br> 
<br>Goodbye
