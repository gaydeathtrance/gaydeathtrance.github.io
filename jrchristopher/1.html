        Sepulchral madness, cabin fever of forests, finds its home in the SE Texan Piney Woods. Lousy with rot, the sloughing off of old fleshliness, remnants of the pine beetle scourge of the 20th century. A tree here is a thing heavier than a placeholder for life. A tree here is a scarred and treacherous husk. The forest floor strata: loblolly needles, nutria rat corpses, kudzu detritus, creek matter. Decay retches the meager scene out, leaving bits in the esophagus scorching the lining in digestive acids. A trail from the mouth to the gnarled fecundity. Remembering the flatulent loam, halfburied rusty scythe, on this earth where no cotton would grow. The imprint, not a memory, of the escaped slaves, shady merchants, the obliterated cannibal Karankawa, banished Caddo. A neverland of shadesong in the kingless days before that diarrheal spume burst forth from Spindletop: oil.
        <br>
        <br>And then the coming of the longdead barons, the uproot and the upswell: Lucas, McFaddin-Ward, Dowlen, Lutcher-Stark, King Vidor. In Exxon blue, in radiation rose. The fisting of the land into treacherous flatness, the making of the beige city of Beaumont, America’s gaping gusher. “Boomtown” - the place where industry forced the rubes to mix with the blacks who came for work and were shunned off of the tight, contracted bus-routes, sat steadfast at lunch counters in places called the Pig Stand, now demolished, debased with condiments, hands held to braziers, spat upon. Lynching was an American pastime and in the old photographs showing the rabble smiling after the deed, no eyes glint as bright as a young white Texan man standing beneath a hanging black corpse, facing the camera with hat cocked in abandonment, a sexual gleam. And later the great white riots burning down the black neighborhoods in the 1940s, the gnarling in of the black community in the face of treachery, murder, torment. The cloistered Pear Orchard, a black neighborhood in Beaumont where whites were admitted only under supervision of escort. The great turning away from the rot of the boomtown factory deaths, already beginning to kill off the warring factions.
        <br>
        <br>Beaumont, home of the largest Dalmatian-spotted fire hydrant. The Rat Pack had their own tunnel from the hotel to the theater back in the 50s – this fart joke of there once being a rabble here who chased down celebrities. Where Ms. Barbara Lynn stood up and warned us in 1962 not to lose a good thing, strumming a left-handed Stratocaster incanting the deathways of her gnarled Texas. Now the downtown is intact and peopled by zombie absentee commuters and the steadfast old queer gangs that endured the firebombing of their moldering nightclubs and whose drag queens fall from roofs, fight dogs in the street, and regale each other with vicious nicknames and betrayals, a redneck Genet pageant. One has fingernails that are a meter long, another tells and retells a story of her childhood friend, raped by a group of men after he batted an eyelid wrong at his daddy’s friends, with a sanding drill bit, perforated into a hobbling howling jackal child. A corrective bleeding out and then driven into the piney woods somewhere and left there. A true story.
        <br>
        <br>They recall the young golden Texan boys who were taken in the streets to be dealt with elsewhere, corpses found by an old psychic lady in a muumuu way out in the swamprot, reading glasses on a chain down far on her nose, a Charon librarian pointing an old finger to the spot where he’d been stuffed, stomach full of cattails and gatorgnawed. The rouge thick on her jowls, she found all the kidnapped queers in those days. Their signal to her was a rosebudding rectal firework in the miasmic factory sky, a terrible oracular laughter in which she caught herself in the evening in front of the TV watching The Golden Girls, sudden gasping at the peripheral presence of a man in the shadow of her dining room with a cigarette hanging from his mouth. He whispered to her, George Jones lyrics or obscure laments or sometimes the precise coordinates of their floating or sunken remains. It was unclear if he was the murderer or the victim, being a blurry redneck avatar.
        <br>
        <br>Now queer militia dreaming inhabits these forests abutting the rice fields, secreted away in the embarrassment of morning, cattle egrets grazing out in the mist – its totem an askew stack of cans of Keystone. The trainees are evening initiates, townies gritting their teeth, days cuckolded in cubicles, hanging IVs in the rear of Acadian ambulettes, forced grins inherited from dead aunts (the higher the hair the closer to God) through the venom at corpulence of suffering uncles, under a duress that something like “normativity” barely gestures toward. Venom is a sticking hate, is big, Texas big, the putrefaction of their days unfolds before them how no partygoer could ever fathom, here at the edge of what can be lived. The rural is in this sense not a place but a zone of rot, conceptual only in speaking it, but in its basest truth a felt zone. Cities can be rural. How myth is not mere untruth but imbued with felt states and this zone is the state of the knowledge of pestilence. On the weekend evenings thick with miasmic fog from the Goodyear plant they shoot bottles, trees, targets, sometimes each other. Jesus take the wheel. Back between Fannett and Cheek (and how precise is its naming, a Skoal scar branded in the mouth – “Uncle Jimmy had half his face taken off after that cancer took his tongue and that face was just a-floppin’ like a empty rubber mask, brother I tell you what.”) Now they gather in Cheek, TX and shoot each other with rifles and rut with tobacco-spit slick on their dicks – sloppy communion unfurled beneath banners of blight. Green sky, green smoke. Swamp beasts <i>chuck-chucking</i> out in the dark parts, loupgarou specters just over the Louisiana border, the gnashing.
        <br>
        <br>Human life costumed in fleshsacks in clumsy choreographed drudgery - enraptured by some waltz out of the leprous shell of armadillo roadkill across Texas to the sodden flat pocket of the Golden Triangle’s abominations, brazenly necrotic. An agape maw of particulate matter blasting forth out of refinery stacks, rectums of industry spouting into good Texan lungs mixing with the dreadsmoke of cowboy killers, burnpiles stoked with Carolina curs and woodpile cats hung from tails in live oaks, buried up to their necks in the clay and yowling heads razed clean by John Deere’s rotor for a teenager’s rasping laugh, a semi-erection. The cajoling of buddy’s bulges, the play of not wanting touch, a dirtstache slick with Monster Energy drink, just for a moment behind the loblollies this ritual of madness, the dithyramb of accursed brotherhood now spent, cum gives way to nothing. Englazed orbs stagnant in skulls, reclined on futons, filthy sneakers, PS3 in the basement. It gets to where you don’t know what’s killing you, brother. I tell you what. The mechanized laughter of Peepaw’s tracheotomy speaking-valve.
        <br>
        <br>The perforation, both of the body in sex and the safety net of the phobic mind, is the beginning of queer rot. The bad and true event of its anality – the very thing they all try to escape in their rushing towards it. The bringing forth of anality to the public scene – what a great shame, Genet knew it well, the fucking back up the ass of the most base and fecund of matters. Homoeroticism is the very structure of the social in this regard, one big farce of grabass masked as territorial barnyard bungling. What is a fudgepacker but the sacred naming of that institution – it is a name of recognition, an accursed name but all the same a welcoming home. The fudgepacker is known. The act transcends sociability; it assails bodily those who recognize it. It is a rectal knowledge. It remains mythic – the cock’s encounter with shit is a matter of chance, unplanned in general, and as a matter of course often avoided. The urethral and the fecal try not to meet in the well-planned anal event. All the same. This is why the fudgepacker is a sort of mythic trickster and reigns over the imaginations of all boys whose venom conceals a deep want. All men, all boys, want to be fudgepackers.
        <br>
        <br>The gnarl is every relation here. Strange time reigns. Things didn’t happen “when”, but “whenever”. Tethered always to the screeching pain of daddy’s abscesses, mama’s dark spells, echoic chamber, perpetuity of calling back – the tart mouth of sociological “phenomena” insufficient. The void is not just a place to find no culture. It is a place to tether one to the act of wallstaring, the sick bed, the ritual of panhandling out on the frontage turnaround. Region is kingdom. One is branded. I tell you what. It is a gnarled synthesis with the regional folkloric form, the Texas tall tale, which always dwells in strange time. “Whenever old Bill Thibodeaux pulled the 20 foot gator out of Cow Bayou, whenever the lightning struck that live oak and it was filled up with guinea hens that flew every which way, whenever Mother Hudgins walked off into the cypress woods, before the war that was, and didn’t never come back, and couldn’t nobody tell why. That was when they still had spiritualist meetings at the First Baptist church on Wednesday evenings and they’d have actors appear hanging in the doorway as ghosts. Ladies in old lace gloves covered in powder that’d wail and cry leaning on a torn parasol, old plantation schoolmasters in monocles that stood and grimaced holding a Bible. And boy did the people eat that up, poor saps. They’d pay to get in.  Whenever I went up there last though that church was in bad shape. Hurricane got into it.”
        <br>
        <br>“Whenever they was first getting’ together she caught him fuckin’ that dog, I swear to fuckin’ God brother. She come in and he’s just fuckin’ away at that dog, hurt the little fucker too man it was a little dog. Stayed with his ass too, she did.” Followed by a rasping laugh, wide-eyed. A canine gaping. And mama at the stove “what the fuck y’all talkin’ bout – Christ but y’all are some nasty motherfuckers!” Ro-Tel tomatoes and green chilies burning in the pan. She turns up her Annie Lennox. Story here is the covenant with the gnarled relation; gnarled into rot it is a promise to bear witness, no balm in Gilead, no sleep for the wicked, no happy ending. Just wallow in the hard-luck, sit with it. Ain’t no gettin’ away from it. Kingfisher off in the cypress knees demonspitting ‘<i>chkchkchkchchk</i>’, a bad cackle. The cypress gnarls in a knee, sprouted from swamp, abrading every surface of itself together. No beginning no end. Keep us wallstaring at some Spencer Gifts blacklight poster of a wizard on a toadstool-smoking hookah. Black metal records from the 90s, scratched CDs, covered in Nederland schwag. Drug dealers that lived in one-room shacks, barely outhouses, with nothing but beds and six or seven ball pythons in darklit tanks.
        <br>
        <br>A great, heavy symbol of Texas is oldtimers sitting around talking shit. More than just weather predictions based on the flaring of kneecaps, there occurs a pestilential hexing – the glee of speculating Hillary Clinton muslimlicked on some slick linen in one of them fancy Yankee hotels. Ventilators thrumming. Through the hiss of his snotflecked cannula, one of these sunbaked tortoises aspirates: “That’s what’ll get you, brother, that ventilator, I tell you what. Keeps you breathing while you rot. All of us in here will go that way. I tell you what.” They address the weirdness of their being presently seated in a clean and well-lit lobby by making vivid the humble and mudbaked origins of their lost domains.  The pantheon of ancestry gets conjured like somebody bringing a powerful creature into play: “Well, that was Uncle Van lived out in the Devil’s Pocket in a lean-to. Motherfucker was so drunk on that shit he pulled from the still he’d drive to town on a car didn’t have any wheels. Just a whole buncha sparks flyin’ and here come Uncle Van. Took him two days to go and come back. Ran all over these pig trails. Grew all his own food too. Pokeweed salad and shit. Tough old motherfucker. Real clean though.” Devil’s Pocket is one of them big places out in Newton County nobody knows where it starts or ends. Swampy and piney and filled with old haunts and sedge and sweetgum, bad roads that lead to the end of your fucking life. They say a meteor chunked out the Pocket back during settler times, and the whole damn place filled up with moccasins. A puddle of writhing balls of snakes fucking. Bears gang rape deer out there and its always nighttime. Way back when there used to be the Dog People out in the Neches River Bottom, so called because of their roving packs of curs. The big city for them was Woodville. They’re all gone now, sunk down maybe under the River Bottom, waitin’ it out til some future summons. Crickets clickin’ in the ferns. They made their own whiskey in buried stills, the rain hits the mud a certain way some nights you can still smell it.
        <br>
        <br>The plumage of swamp birds caked in the mud of this gnarled pageant. The retinue of gallinule, lilyhopper, rail, bittern, anhinga (swamp turkey, secret crow) - all of the cattail marsh skulkers. An enlarged throat sac, the subsonic wave of the bittern’s song. Blast of deep. Bereft of sirenians, the Texan swamp is patient in its sick plenty. No SE Texan sky, the zenith of which comes all the way down to one’s knees, realizes full composition without an obligatory vulturine rotsniffer maintenance team, locked in perpetual glazed gliding vigilance weaving on the thermal drafts. One might count 300 in a day, a whole wake of them, mixed flock of Black and Turkey, vortexing half a mile up, all for some gibbet buried down in the rot. And then perched silent on the latticed steel transmission towers. The Blacks scan for kill while the Turkeys sniff, make veering descent athwart the drafts, alight with ungainly hops and hiss to one another across the dusk’s hum. The windfall being dogs, roadkilled big curs, some with collars. On a summer morning one might lay intact, baking in a ravine. By afternoon they’ve dragged its gleaming viscera spiteful across the farm-to-market road. And the next morning just a clean femur bone in the ditch. And no sign of the collar, even. Has it been spirited to some vulturine altar? This is no aberration, but the final debasement in a series of canine torment common to this place of old ways. It is a form of stewardship to harm one’s curs, strap them glorious with frayed twine to the wide tow hitch of some lowboy and barreling breakneck down the road, gravel pelting them. One swerve and the arrangement goes into an elaborate last rite, a dog dragged for a ways and left by a coveralled clodhopper gumming a pipe. His master’s voice in his skull with each bounce on the highway’s shoulder. Bad. Dog. Bad. Dog. Down. Down. And then the vultures. What excoriates the vengeful vulturine deities, Coragyps or Cathartes, the ditchgods, is the hunger of the rotsniffers for Jim Bob or old Buzz, the want in their gaze, staring upon the odorous ham that is the body of a fat or even grizzled refinery operator, bound in Nomex coveralls and exuding pubic stink and beersweat. But how rare this feast, as the man has others who watch out for him, apparently, scandalized by the very same to befall him upon his frontage roads, his turnarounds, the curve of his parking lots. And especially there, for people gather there and let no man rot for longer than is tasteful. Everything falls to a strip mall parking lot at sunset. A big tired man in a suit, an engorged Gailard Sartain with mellorine cheeks, might pour himself laboriously from an F-350, all that rot ramping up, under the hungry vigilance of the vulture sentries. The shell of life ushers him from space to space, from the truck to the bank or the grocery, keeping his big softness like a meat core hidden, protected, propelled on the weak slipstream of his groundchuck farts. And even that flash of vulnerability, the sidling incomprehensible drunken bear shamble from the parking lot, is curtailed by a trip to Sonic where one reposes after pushing a button, and wheezing from even the strain of that. They invented carhops for this purpose, eager teens on rollerblades now with neon rubber bands on their teeth, names of Jayden or Brayden or Graydon in a halfassed 50s pantomime. They bring you drinks called Oceanwaters.
        <br>
        <br>Accrual chafes at the bodyhusks, the hard-luck stories narrating the stubborn, dogged throwing of the unfortunate flesh sack into things, coming up against the impasse, the line past which things become intolerable. But nothing is intolerable, as it turns out. The great dynastic white trash families wield accrual in the arena of suffering. The exposure of the bodyhusk, the “look what has become of me,” the places of rupture, atrophy, calcification, jaundice, blackening, death, rot. The gathering of husks hitched to oxygen tanks, strapped to Rascals. The gathering up of wounds and ailments worn like fat broaches upon the convex hurt chest adorning the ribcage. The scarred warrior hick, demented on Dilaudid, sporting stubs. The gnarl’s home is a carapace of hurt. Nails perforating the flesh, roofs crushing skulls, lovers swept off down at Crystal Beach on a bed of brown kelp or sitting on a sofa in the warm Gulf wash. All the Candyman’s halfburied boy victims, rectums and urethras perforated by glass pipettes and needlenose pliers, buried out on High Island in their bellbottoms and heavy bangs. Only the vision of the redeyed Roseate Spoonbills, the carotenoid pigment of a krillfed avian eye, can scan for them now. Their last moments in a rape van in 1971 thinkin’ they was gonna get high on dope before being strapped to the rack and fiddled with to death. And what were they doing out there? “Hell, they was <i>all</i> fucked up. Now they rottin’ somewheres.” (rasping laughter, hacking cough)
