        <b>PANCAKES</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>I have begun
<br>
<br>enjoying pancakes again
<br>
<br>after long associating them
<br>
<br>with periods of bad funds.
<br>
<br>It's not their fault
<br>
<br>that they&mdash;
<br>
<br>like I&mdash;
<br>
<br>exist simply, cost effectively, and tastily.
<br>
<br>The truth smacks
<br>
<br>like a thorn-covered hand
<br>
<br>sometimes.
<br>
<br>While sometimes
<br>
<br>blowing kisses
<br>
<br>behind your back.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>RA-RA</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>Many laughed
<br>
<br>in agreement
<br>
<br>with 6-year-old Ra-Ra's assessment
<br>
<br>that my coworker's breath
<br>
<br>'be smelling like some cheese
<br>
<br>from out the trash.'
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>INFINITE, ETERNAL, AND ALL-POWERFUL</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>I stopped mid-stride
<br>
<br>in the kitchen
<br>
<br>eyeing a pan
<br>
<br>and thought, 'is he...is he gonna do it?' (make an omelet)
<br>
<br>and then made an omelet.
<br>
<br>And yeah
<br>
<br>this poem is about
<br>
<br>'nothing.'
<br>
<br>It's about something 'mundane' and 'everyday.'
<br>
<br>Except it's not
<br>
<br>because it involves me.
<br>
<br>And I am infinite, eternal, and all-powerful.
<br>
<br>contained by nothing
<br>
<br>and extending to the hearts of all breathing creatures.
<br>
<br>A butterfly wearing a football helmet.
<br>
<br>I'm gonna get you.
<br>
<br>I've been ready forever, or
<br>
<br>for sure for the last five minutes or so.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>TWO MODES</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>Looking at life
<br>
<br>like the last ten minutes
<br>
<br>of a sleepover
<br>
<br>where you try to make it seem
<br>
<br>like you were never there
<br>
<br>or
<br>
<br>like an apartment
<br>
<br>on the last night of a lease
<br>
<br>where you're definitely not
<br>
<br>getting the security deposit back.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>I'm a pinchy grandma.
<br>
<br>Or a soul-stealing
<br>
<br>hitman from hell.
<br>
<br>Who the fuck are you.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>THE WOMEN AT THE GROCERY STORE</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>The women at the grocery store
<br>
<br>who work the cash registers
<br>
<br>all have short, feathered haircuts
<br>
<br>and thicker Chicago accents than anyone in Chicago.
<br>
<br>In general, they stand around whichever one lane is open
<br>
<br>ignoring you
<br>
<br>while talking about your purchases
<br>
<br>as they come down the conveyor.
<br>
<br>The women at the grocery store are an important part of my life right now.
<br>
<br>Yes, now, and for the foreseeable future.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>+
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>JOETTE</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>I carried two armloads of cardboarded and taped books into the post office and dropped them on the counter.
<br>
<br>The old clerk walked up slowly, smiling and muttering 'oh jeez' as her bangs blew a little.
<br>
<br>'What's up, how you doing,' I said smiling.
<br>
<br>'Why don't you hyave a hyat on,' she said, toneless and slow, kind of smiling.
<br>
<br>We stood there in quiet as she tapped a computer screen with arthritic hands and put stickers on my packages.
<br>
<br>'This darn ting,' she said, tapping and tapping.
<br>
<br>'What's it doing,' I said.
<br>
<br>She mentioned my address. 'Isn't dat...wasn't dat fire dair.'
<br>
<br>We talked about the building in my area of apartment buildings, that burnt down right before I moved into town.
<br>
<br>A man coming home early from work had seen the building on fire and evacuated everyone.
<br>
<br>'Tank god he was dair,' said the clerk, her wispy bangs bouncing as she blinked.
<br>
<br>Another customer came in, old woman, who basically dropped herself onto the counter--purse and keys crashing.
<br>
<br>She remained, staring down.
<br>
<br>'How's it going, Joette,' said the clerk, in a soft singsong.
<br>
<br>'Vuhhhhh,' said Joette, with a deeply toned sound, like a vacuum that wasn't gonna start.
<br>
<br>'Yeah,' said the clerk.
<br>
<br>'Yeah,' I said.
<br>
<br>We were all quiet for a moment.
<br>
<br>'Vuhhhhh,' said Joette again.
<br>
<br>Then she looked up from the counter in a weird lean.
<br>
<br>'You got inny stamps, hun,' she said.
<br>
<br>Her voice so deep it rattled my balls.
<br>
<br>Joette.
<br>
<br>My ball-rattling queen.
<br>
<br>The clerk showed her the available stamps and Joette, well, she found one so 'absolutely gorchiss' she picked it right away.
<br>
<br>Yes it was clear that none other would do.
<br>
<br>'Do you mind if I?' she said to me, pointing towards the clerk.
<br>
<br>'Yeah, go ahead,' I said.
<br>
<br>And the clerk rang Joette up on the other register.
<br>
<br>And Joette left.   <br>
