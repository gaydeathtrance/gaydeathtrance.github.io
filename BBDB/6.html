  Rejoice, B, for I’m leaving Denver. I’m moving to Wisconsin on January 15th to be around my mom and aid her as she continues to decline. I’ve an obligation to my flesh and blood. I know you understand what it’s like, and that it’s the right choice. 
<br>
<br>I do want to offer you a final apology and final words. I hope you read them and take them to heart. 
<br>
<br>I’m sorry for sending an email to your work email. That was so wrong. In the moment, I didn’t think to send you a letter. Or maybe it seemed more immediate. C, when he was talking at me for twenty minutes at Trade, characterized it as a vindictive act. I wasn’t trying to get you in trouble at your job. That really wasn’t the point of that. The point was telling you how you made me feel. Nothing bad has happened from it, has it? Bureaucracies like the one you work for are just not that organized or closely surveilled. You said I made you seem like such a bad person in that email, but all I did was relay my experience with you. It’s hard to conceive of yourself as having been a bad person while surrounded by yes-men. It’s not libel, after all, if it’s true. 
<br>
<br>Let’s talk about what is vindictive, though. Or at least volatile, because I imagine your friend group has fed to and reinforced for one another that I am this volatile, unstable person. The butt of many jokes, surely. 
<br>
<br>You hooked up with your friend’s physically abusive ex, after he left town. You drove J to court, for God’s sake, to get a restraining order against him. Three of your friends have reached out and told me what kind of friend you’ve been to them. I wonder if you think that J and I hooked up, and that’s why you manifested such negativity. When J hooked up with M, before he said to you who it was with, you were ready to think it was with me. Well, he and I never did anything. Not even kiss. It’s not like he didn’t give me the chance, either. I didn’t, though, because I knew it would hurt you, even though you’d never admit it. It’s insecurity itself to never want to appear to be made to feel insecure. And despite how you hurt me, and the nasty things I wrote to you, I never wanted to hurt you. Or maybe you were hurt just because J and I became friends. Good, close, supportive friends. I don’t hook up with my friend’s exes or my ex’s friends. I’m not like you, and I have to thank you for so exactly locating my values, guiding principles, and how I want to treat others, in contrast to how you treat others. You’ve been a great unintentional teacher. I’m grateful for your lessons.
<br>
<br>Irv reached out to me, too, after you did that. He was clearly thirsty as well, and I declined. He said he didn’t like the way your friend group labeled me, that it wasn’t fair. I can only imagine how I’m viewed among the Messes. 
<br>
<br>T spoke to me pretty recently and frankly one night about how he feels about your friendship to him. It’s strange to have such Tea spill on one’s shore, when all I want to do is move on and be in a healthy, loving relationship with a healthy, loving partner. It’s strange you come to Sweet when you know I work there. I see and do the ignore game with you once a week it seems, and it’s hurtful and stressful every time, and haunts me for hours and days after. There are so many other places you can go. Soon, you can go wherever you want. I will ask that you respect this boundary, and stop from coming to my bar until I’m gone. It’s not that long. Please, let me be. Unless you want an honest conversation before I go. I doubt that, and I don’t need that. If that’s something you feel you need, you know how and where to find me.
<br>
<br>When I last went to Wisconsin to check in on my mom, and found out she has lost her sense of smell (a symptom of Alzheimer’s, which it turns out is what is happening to her; there was a black mold infestation in her bathroom and she had no concept of it), I heard from my best friend that you threw yourself at him at my bar, shoving your hands in his shirt and down his pants. It made me glad and relieved I have loyal friends. You told me to leave you alone. You should do the same. That includes leaving my friends alone.
<br>
<br>This past beer bust, when I was exiting the patio, and I saw you pantomiming a blowjob and snorting a line, and your group fell silent, and I, likely looking quite dour, squeezed past you in tight quarters, and after a few more paces heard the group cackle, you by far the loudest, it made me feel so awful, and I cried when I got home. I’m leaving Denver for my mom, but I’m also leaving for myself. It’s for both of us. Also, for my grandmother. In a way, I’m leaving Denver for you, too.
<br>
<br>The common thing your friends said to me about you, was that you do and take what you want, regardless of the consequences of who it will hurt. I think if you think about yourself and what you do, you’ll have a hard time denying that is true. You’re old and smart enough to know better, and you’re strong enough to do something about it. It might be time to wipe the powder off the mirror and look at yourself in it. When your head hits the pillow, when the night’s been spent, and you can’t sleep, it might be time to think about why it is you can’t sleep. The thing about living only for yourself is how unbearably lonely it gets. 
<br>
<br>I care about you deeply. Who else would’ve referred you to a therapist? (can you think of a friend?) But being kind doesn’t always mean being nice. Actions have consequences, and one of those is getting your character judged. You’ve changed my life forever. I hope you can find happiness, health, and love. You’ll always be my special mess.
