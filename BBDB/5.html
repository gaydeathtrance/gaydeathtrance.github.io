Block all electronic communication from this point forward if I have not already done so
<br>
<br>When I see you at a bar, a curt hello or nod is more than enough
<br>
<br>Ignoring each other is fine, too
<br>
<br>I will see how much energy I can put into not putting energy into it
<br>
<br>When I squeeze past you and friends in shoulder-to-shoulder situations, excusing myself, give me a thumbs-up
<br>
<br>Let me know I am doing the ignoring right
<br>
<br>Yes, it was very terrible and shitty of me
<br>
<br>Speech is action
<br>
<br>Words do things in life
<br>
<br>I proved you wrong by being wrong
<br>
<br>Here, a new cruel reality of language I am hiding behind
<br>
<br>This is me at my worst
<br>
<br>This is me at my best
<br>
<br>You will never trust me again
<br>
<br>Make sure to send scouts ahead of you into rooms, to do the reconnaissance of me
<br>
<br>Triangulate my locale to optimize avoidance
<br>
<br>The cleanliness of being shrewd, callous, and impinged by fear of blades
<br>
<br>Take feverish delight in self-directed mutilation
<br>
<br>Find someone who does not care about you to insert hypodermic needles in your scrotum
<br>
<br>Stabbed repeatedly with increasing vigor
<br>
<br>Writhe, slap the mattress, transmute grunts into whimpers and cries
<br>
<br>Tell me I am the best
<br>
<br>Tell me no one has ever done this, made you feel this way, before
<br>
<br>Tell me I do not know what I think I know
<br>
<br>Tell me what you think I think I know
<br>
<br>Provide opportunities to be self-righteous
<br>
<br>Invite my broke self to collaborate on stir-fry whenever I want
<br>
<br>Holding hands, walking down a red carpet fashioned from the red flags we joint-prolapsed
<br>
<br>What, after all, is a clinger to a flake?
<br>
<br>Self-effacement unfurling the ripples of its narcissism
<br>
<br>(I will never have a job with diarrhea breaks)
<br>
<br>Remove your shirt, tuck it into your waist
<br>
<br>Playfully and affectionately grind your head in the chest of someone you met recently
<br>
<br>Forgiveness is terrifying when you are not expecting to be forgiven
<br>
<br>When you have been a bad person, and someone loves you anyway
<br>
<br>I will never earn your hatred
<br>
<br>You will never earn my hatred
<br>
<br>My father told me, after not seeing him for eleven years, that insight does not necessarily mean change
