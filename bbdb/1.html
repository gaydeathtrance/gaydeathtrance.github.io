        <b>Pookie's Blues</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>I have Pookie’s Blues
<br>
<br>Let me tell you what that is
<br>
<br>We were in bed last month
<br>
<br>And I made up a song about him
<br>
<br>Pookie’s Blues
<br>
<br>And we improvised verses back and forth
<br>
<br>And made each other laugh
<br>
<br>And the window was cracked
<br>
<br>Because the building was hot
<br>
<br>And it was nice outside
<br>
<br>And it was nice inside
<br>
<br>And it was morning
<br>
<br>And we were holding each other
<br>
<br>Singing Pookie’s Blues
<br>
<br>That’s what I have
<br>
<br>That’s what I’m singing
<br>
<br>It’s a song I made up
<br>
<br>And now I’m the only one who knows how it goes
<br>
<br>And I’m not going to tell you how it goes
<br>
<br>And I’m never going to tell you
<br>
<br>Because I’m never going to be able to tell you
<br>
<br>And it’s not because I can’t remember
<br>
<br>I remember how it goes
<br>
<br>I’m never going to be able to tell you
<br>
<br>Because I'm the only one who has it
<br>
<br>I have Pookie's Blues
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><b>Narrative of Loss</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>I was on the phone with his friend
<br>
<br>Who pounded on his door for minutes
<br>
<br>Who said the hallway smelled bad
<br>
<br>His friend contacted another friend
<br>
<br>Who hadn't heard from him either
<br>
<br>Who called in a welfare check
<br>
<br>
<br>An old you stacked on top of the new
<br>
<br>Mess of self
<br>
<br>What the ghost of learned judgments
<br>
<br>Incessantly berates
<br>
<br>
<br>Firefighters broke into his apartment
<br>
<br>While we waited by the sidewalk
<br>
<br>A knot of dread at my core
<br>
<br>The paramedic cried more than I did
<br>
<br>But she actually saw him
<br>
<br>
<br>Don’t be sad because it’s over
<br>
<br>Be sad because your narrative of loss
<br>
<br>Is getting cleaner and more abbreviated
<br>
<br>
<br>We filled out police reports
<br>
<br>And were interviewed by a detective
<br>
<br>Recording us with a body camera
<br>
<br>
<br>Our trauma is mediated by an authoritarian state
<br>
<br>(Hearing the most distant siren spikes my heart rate now)
<br>
<br>And our authoritarian state is authored
<br>
<br>By our desire to control
<br>
<br>Ourselves
<br>
<br>Our narratives of loss
<br>
<br>Our body cameras are recording
<br>
<br>I didn't break down until I was alone
<br>
<br>
<br>People have been posting
<br>
<br>Reacting
<br>
<br>Commenting
<br>
<br>Wanting to know more
<br>
<br>Memorializing
<br>
<br>Saying who he was
<br>
<br>When they first met
<br>
<br>How much he meant to them
<br>
<br>How important they were to him (???)
<br>
<br>How much they will miss him
<br>
<br>
<br>How much will I miss him?
<br>
<br>That’s not a question I can answer
<br>
<br>Until I’ve lived the rest of my life
<br>
<br>And even then
<br>
<br>He will be the only one I want to tell
<br>
<br>
<br>Emotionally corporatized
<br>
<br>We repeat-binge-watch our interior lives
<br>
<br>Looking for Easter eggs
<br>
<br>And forgotten cups
<br>
<br>Looping back for clues
<br>
<br>And answers to questions that aren’t questions
<br>
<br>But stories we tell to middle-manage an unruly love
<br>
<br>We feel but can’t understand
<br>
<br>Lodged in the sickness of an impossible knowledge
<br>
<br>Time clenches our teeth for us
<br>
<br>Evicted from thought
<br>
<br><i>What was I saying? My point . . .</i>
<br>
<br>
<br>My point:
<br>
<br>Your life has a direction
<br>
<br>But it’s hard to know any more than that
