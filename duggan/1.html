        1.
<br>
<br>Just as every snowflake melts alike
<br>all these backroads look the same,
<br>and I take a wrong turn into a lifetime
<br>of selling mattresses. But I guess you can’t
<br>expect the whole ocean in one seashell.
<br>I guess I don’t know why you fear sleep
<br>when you don’t snore and you won’t dream.
<br>Me, I pass out at work, I wake too late—
<br>late August, everyone fleeing their vacation,
<br>and I lose you forever to bad traffic.
<br>Already I forget my last nightmare,
<br>something about a lobster chewing
<br>the shell he just cast off, busy as I am
<br>trying to calculate a way back to you
<br>that doesn’t require turnpike exits.
<br><br><br><br>
<br>2.
<br>
<br>Another day goes to voicemail.
<br>I play ‘Chicken’ with myself
<br>until I wake unemployed
<br>in a Super 8. I spend whole afternoons
<br>sunbathing on railroad tracks.
<br>These risks are necessary.
<br>I must get to the palsied last breath
<br>of a closeout sale. The crustaceans
<br>are cheapest in recession. For you,
<br>I’ll admit it. My long lost
<br>coupon hoarder, I still hope to find
<br>you in that place where my warranties
<br>finally void.
<br><br><br><br><br>
3.
<br>
<br>The lease ends
<br>so I squat in my own heart,
<br>spend the rest of my days dreaming
<br>of lost teeth. Yes, I am shallower
<br>than a cricket.
<br>I needed this grief to realize
<br>there’s no romance in singing
<br>with your knees, with the body’s yielding.
<br>What has love ever done anyway
<br>besides crash my last Honda Civic?
<br>I want to learn instead from the seafloor,
<br>where the crabs replace their departed wives
<br>with rocks. It is dark down there, after all.
<br>Who will tell the difference?
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br>4.
<br>
<br>The prom is not saved.
<br>You are defeated by your sadness
<br>in a sports stadium named after
<br>cheap auto-insurance policies.
<br>I remain a drug-addicted
<br>shoe salesman, and the stars
<br>are a long distance from me here
<br>in China, Maine. Let the losses pile
<br>like waves, like seals virused
<br>and glittering on a shore:
<br>so we were promised love,
<br>so the liver is a sledgehammer,
<br>so this austerity will never end,
<br>so what? We can bleed endlessly.
<br>We are jellyfish, our blood
<br>only jelly, and we’ll never
<br>fall for a disguise again, because
<br>everyone should know everyone else
<br>is fake and a face is nothing
<br>more than the light Velcroed to it.
<br>At the bar I send back my beer.
<br>There are better ways
<br>to be hammered, better ways
<br>of becoming a nail.
